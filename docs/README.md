  - See request/response schemas

- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/redoc
  - Clean, searchable API reference
  - Better for reading/printing

## What's Not Documented

These features are planned for future documentation:

- [ ] Deployment guide (Docker Compose, cloud hosting)
- [ ] Authentication/authorization setup
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Monitoring and logging setup
- [ ] Performance tuning guide
- [ ] API rate limiting configuration
- [ ] Multi-user support

## Contributing to Documentation

1. Documentation is written in **Markdown**
2. Follow the existing structure
3. Use code examples where helpful
4. Keep language clear and concise
5. Test all code examples before adding them

**Style Guide**:
- Use `code blocks` for commands, code, and file paths
